Let's create the following folder structure:
```
 |
 |-front-end
 |--|-html
 |--|-css
 |--|-javascript
 |
 |-back-end
```
Let's create two separate branches called:
```
	- front-end
	- back-end
```
In each branch create the apropriate folders and start coding :)

Git commands:
`git clone <repo>` - clones the repo to your machine
`git add .` - add all changed files to staging area
`git commit -m "<message>"` - create a new commit with a message
`git checkout -b <new branch name>` - create a new branch and switch to it
`git merge <branch name>` - merges the branch to the current branch
